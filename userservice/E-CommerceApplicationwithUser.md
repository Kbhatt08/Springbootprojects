# E-Commerce Application with User and Order Services

## Overview

You are tasked with developing an **E-Commerce Platform** with a microservices architecture using Spring Boot. The platform will consist of two microservices: **User Service** and **Order Service**.

- **User Service** will handle user management (authentication and user data).
- **Order Service** will handle the creation and management of orders placed by users.

The application will be **secured with OAuth 2.0**, with **PostgreSQL** as the database and **Kafka** for messaging between microservices.

**Kafka**:
- **Consumer**: Listens to Kafka messages from **User Service** to process orders when a new user is created.
  
**OAuth 2.0 Security**:
- Protects API endpoints using JWT tokens issued by the Authorization Server.
- Users can only access their own orders based on the OAuth 2.0 tokenâ€™s claims (i.e., user_id).

**Swagger Documentation**: Document the API endpoints and authentication flows using Swagger.

---

### 3. OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server (Keycloak/Auth0/Okta)

**Responsibilities**:
- Issue OAuth 2.0 tokens (JWT).
- Authenticate users when they attempt to log in.
- Authorize access to the **User Service** and **Order Service** based on the roles assigned to the user (e.g., `USER`, `ADMIN`).
- Provide an authorization endpoint, token endpoint, and user info endpoint for OAuth 2.0 flows.
  
**Configuration**:
- Keycloak is configured with two clients: **User Service** and **Order Service**.
- Both clients are configured with **Authorization Code Flow** (OAuth 2.0).
- The Authorization Server issues JWT tokens for authenticated users and validates tokens for the microservices.

---

## Flow of Interaction Between Services

1. **User Authentication:**
   - A user requests access to the application.
   - The user is redirected to the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server** for authentication.
   - Upon successful authentication, the server issues a **JWT token**.

2. **User Service Interaction:**
   - The **User Service** receives the **JWT token** in the request header.
   - It validates the token and processes the request (e.g., registering the user, fetching user data).

3. **Kafka Messaging:**
   - After user registration, the **User Service** sends a Kafka message to notify the **Order Service** of the new user.
   
4. **Order Service Interaction:**
   - The **Order Service** consumes the Kafka message sent by the **User Service**.
   - It processes the order based on the new user details.
   - The **Order Service** verifies the **JWT token** to ensure the request is from an authenticated user and allows them to place an order.

5. **Order Creation & Management:**
   - The user can create an order via the **Order Service** API, secured by OAuth 2.0.
   - The **Order Service** checks if the user is authorized (based on the `user_id` in the JWT token).

## Optional Enhancements

- **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to APIs to prevent abuse.
- **Service Discovery**: Use Spring Cloud Eureka for microservices discovery if deploying in a distributed system.
- **Caching**: Integrate Redis or Ehcache to cache frequently accessed data, such as user information.

---

This detailed scenario provides a complete picture of the architecture, components, and flow of data between the services. You can now proceed with the implementation based on these details.


# User Service Application Overview

The **User Service Application** is responsible for managing user-related operations such as registration, authentication, and user data retrieval. It ensures that only authorized users can access protected resources in the system, and it also communicates with the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server** to manage user tokens (like JWT tokens).

---

## 1. User Registration Flow

When a new user registers, the following steps occur:

- **User Submits Registration Data**:
  - The user provides details such as:
    - `username`
    - `email`
    - `password` (hashed before storage)
  - You will **hash the password** before storing it to ensure it's secure. You can use a library like `BCrypt` for password hashing in Spring Security.

- **User Data Stored in PostgreSQL**:
  - The **User Service** stores this data in the **PostgreSQL database**. 
  - A typical `User` table could look like this:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```
  - The **password** stored in the database is **hashed** (not in plaintext), and other information like `username`, `email`, and `created_at` is stored as is.

- **Sending User to OAuth Server**:
  - After storing the user data, the **User Service** communicates with the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server** (e.g., **Keycloak** or **Auth0**).
  - The Authorization Server will be responsible for issuing tokens, handling authentication, and managing user sessions.

- **Successful Registration Response**:
  - Once the registration is successful, the **User Service** might return a response like:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "User registered successfully",
      "status": "success"
    }
    ```

  The **OAuth 2.0 token** (JWT) is not issued immediately during registration but will be issued during the login process (explained below).

---

## 2. User Login Flow

When a user logs in:

- **User Submits Login Data**:
  - The user provides:
    - `username`
    - `password`

- **Password Validation**:
  - The **User Service** first checks the database to find the user associated with the provided `username` (or `email`, depending on your preference).
  - Then, the **User Service** compares the **hashed password** stored in the database with the password provided by the user. The comparison uses the same hashing algorithm (e.g., `BCrypt`) to ensure the passwords match.

- **Token Issuance** (via OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server):
  - If the credentials are valid (i.e., username and password match), the **User Service** communicates with the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server** to request an OAuth 2.0 **Access Token** (usually a JWT token).
  - This token contains the **userâ€™s details** (like `user_id`, `username`, `roles`, etc.) and is used for authentication in subsequent requests.
  - The **Authorization Server** issues the token and returns it to the **User Service**.

- **Response with JWT Token**:
  - The **User Service** then responds with the token to the client (e.g., frontend or mobile app).
  - Example response:
    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "<JWT Token>",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "token_type": "Bearer"
    }
    ```

- **Token Usage**:
  - The client now stores this **JWT token** (usually in memory or local storage on the frontend) and includes it in the **Authorization header** for subsequent requests to the backend.
  - For example, to access a protected route, the client sends:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>
    ```

  - The **User Service** (and other microservices) will validate the JWT token in every request to ensure that itâ€™s issued by a trusted OAuth 2.0 server and is valid (not expired or tampered).

---

## 3. What Information Do You Store?

In the **User Service**, you store:

- **User Information**:
  - `username`: Unique username to identify the user.
  - `email`: User's email address, often used for notifications and authentication.
  - `password`: **Hashed** password (never store plaintext passwords).
  - `created_at`: The date and time when the user was registered.

  This data is typically stored in a **PostgreSQL database** in a `users` table.

- **Password Handling**:
  - **Never store passwords in plaintext**. Use a hashing function such as **BCrypt** or **PBKDF2** to securely store the password.
  - When the user logs in, you **hash the input password** and compare it to the stored hash. If they match, the user is authenticated.

---

## 4. OAuth Token and Its Role

- **JWT Token**:
  - The **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server** issues a **JWT token** when the user successfully logs in.
  - The token contains user-related data (e.g., `user_id`, `roles`).
  - This JWT is used for authentication in future API requests. The token validates the userâ€™s identity and permissions.
  
- **Token Expiration**:
  - The token has an **expiration time** (`expires_in`) after which the user will need to refresh the token or log in again.
  - In a production system, you may implement **refresh tokens** to allow the user to renew the access token without re-entering their credentials.

---

## 5. Structure of the User Service and Its Endpoints

Hereâ€™s a basic structure for the **User Service** and its functionalities:

### a) **User Registration Endpoint** (`POST /users/register`)
- Request:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "john_doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "password": "secure_password"
    }
    ```
- Operation: Stores user in the PostgreSQL database, sends a request to the OAuth Authorization Server.
- Response:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "User registered successfully",
      "status": "success"
    }
    ```

### b) **User Login Endpoint** (`POST /users/login`)
- Request:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "john_doe",
      "password": "secure_password"
    }
    ```
- Operation: Validates credentials, generates an OAuth token by communicating with the Authorization Server.
- Response:
    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "jwt_token",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "token_type": "Bearer"
    }
    ```

### c) **Get User Info Endpoint** (`GET /users/{id}`)
- Request: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>`
- Operation: Retrieves user information from the database using the `user_id` in the token.
- Response:
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "john_doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00"
    }
    ```

---

## Summary of User Service Flow:

1. **Registration**: The user submits their username, email, and password, which is stored in PostgreSQL after hashing the password.
2. **Login**: The user submits their credentials (username and password). The password is verified against the stored hash. If valid, a JWT token is issued.
3. **OAuth Token**: The JWT token is used for authentication in future API requests. The token validates the userâ€™s identity and permissions.

This architecture ensures secure user management, handles login and registration processes, and integrates OAuth 2.0 for token-based security.
